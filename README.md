My ideas for the ultimate operating system, includes organization, shortcuts, features

Things are as simple as they seem because they were designed that way.



## Features
Simple
- Everything has been re-thought. Fewer apps are needed because they each do much more without increasing complexity.

Fast
- Only the minimal necessary resources are loaded as they are needed.
- Dev: There are minimal abstraction layers.

Customizable
- Config files are full featured and as simple to adjust as text files.

Full support for keyboard-power-users.



## Other
Generic apps:
- Calculator
- Explorer (internet and local files)
- Notes (includes TODOs)
- Social
- System



## Experimental
Eventually, these ideas will be moved to more specific areas.

app-key + f1: show keyboard shortcuts. (would work for all apps, would be able to toggle profiles and modify shortcuts).
Might just leave f1 as help? Though eventually make it easy to change?
